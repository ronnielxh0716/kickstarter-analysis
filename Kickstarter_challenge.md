# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
work on the excel sheet with all the formula needed to create charts and tables to identify correlations between different datas. 

### Purpose
To help Louise find out how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals.

## Analysis and Challenges

  * properly use formula 
  * creat pivot tables using the right filters and values
  * select the most suitable charts to represent the datas  


### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

  * There are more successful launches than failed launches throughout the year.
  * Number of canceled launches stays rather evenly with minor changes throughout the year.
  * Number of successful lanches peaks significantly in May and goes down through the rest of the year with minor lift in October.
  * Trend of failed launches stays similar to that of successful launches with gentle fluctuation.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

  * No lanches were canceled
  * Goal with the amount of 'less than 1000' has the highest successful rate, 
  * Goal between '45000to49999' has the lowest successful rate. All of them failed
  * Goal between '25000to29999' has the 2nd lowest successful rate.

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

  * The best month to launch a campaige is May.
  * The success rate and fail rate are approximately the same in December while the launches are more likely to succeed than fail in other months of the year.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

  * Campaigns with goals less than 4999 have the highest successful rate while ones with goals larger than 45000 are much less likely to succeed.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

  * limited number of campaigns with large goals results in limited accuracy of success rate calculation
  * limited information on backers to analyse for demographic targetting
  
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
  
  * Outcomes based on 'staff_pick' and 'spotlight'
